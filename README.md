# JavaScript-Movie-App

As a budding front-end developer eager to master the fundamentals, I created this web application as a hands-on exercise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By building interactive features and a user-friendly interface, I aimed to solidify my understanding of these core technologies. This project allowed me to experiment with dynamic elements, such as the interactive sliders, quote generator, and trivia quiz, while also refining my skills in creating visually appealing and intuitive designs. I'm particularly proud of how I've integrated JavaScript to enhance user engagement. You can click the link to the website application here: https://scintillating-froyo-01bec6.netlify.app/.
